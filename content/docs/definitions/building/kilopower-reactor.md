## Description
The Kilopower Reactor provides ~20 kWe. It contains two 10 kWe modules, each with a reactor core using depleted uranium as fuel source. It uses stirling converters for generating power via mechanical movement of pistons inside as passive sodium heat pipes transport thermal energy between the core containment can (hot end) and the vacuum chambers (cold end). A circular radiator panel is mounted on top for heat dissipation. It includes a 10 kWh backup power battery.
