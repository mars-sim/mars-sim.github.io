## Description
The TOPAZ-2A Reactor is a minor improvement of the TOPAZ-II reactor &#10;system, which was developed by Soviet Union in 1987 for use by Cosmos 1818 &#10;and Cosmos 1867 satellites in space. Based on thermionic energy conversion &#10;with highly enriched uranium oxide pellet as fuel, it was cooled by &#10;liquid-metal consisting of sodium and potassium. It has 37 single-cell TFEs, &#10;with a much improved 10.5% thermal-to-electrical conversion efficiency to &#10;provide ~10.03 kWe at 83.3% load capacity.
