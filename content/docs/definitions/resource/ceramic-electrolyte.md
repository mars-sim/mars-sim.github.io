## Description
 &#10;&#9;&#9;The ceramic electrolyte &#10;&#9;&#9;is highly ion-conductive and chemically stable for making batteries and fuel cells. &#10;&#9;&#9;This solid metal oxide is an insulator that will not conduct electricity. However, it &#10;&#9;&#9;is capable of conducting oxygen ions and suitable for cell reactions.
