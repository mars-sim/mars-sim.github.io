## Description
 Aluminized Mylar is a reflective, &#10;&#9; electrical insulating material. It contains a coat of aluminum, resulting in a silver-colored radiant &#10;&#9; barrier that reflects radiant heat and thermal radiation. It shields Space Stations against the &#10;&#9; thermal radiation of the sun and the bitter cold of space. See &#39;Efficiency of aluminized mylar &#10;&#9; insulation at cryogenic temperatures&#39; by James B. Heaney
