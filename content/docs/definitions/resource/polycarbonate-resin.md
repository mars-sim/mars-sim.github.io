## Description
 &#10;&#9;&#9;These are partially bio-based&#10;&#9;&#9;polycarbonates made use of renewable feedstocks (food waste) and CO2. See&#10;&#9;&#9;https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/Natalie%20Bittner.pdf. They&#10;&#9;&#9;are strong, tough materials, easily worked, molded, and thermoformed.
