## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;A thermoplastic polymer stiffer than polyethylene. Characterized by a more &#10;&#9;&#9;transparent appearance and higher tensile strength, polypropylene bags &#10;&#9;&#9;offer a higher heat and chemical resistance than polyethylene bags, as well &#10;&#9;&#9;as rigid protective edges to prevent scratches. Polypropylene is a soft, &#10;&#9;&#9;flexible type of plastic that is considered safer than other plastics.
