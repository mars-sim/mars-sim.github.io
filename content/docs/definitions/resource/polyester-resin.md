## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;Polyester resin is a liquid in its uncured state. It&#39;s a thermoplastic polymer. &#10;&#9;&#9;The most common, highest volume produced polyester is Polyethylene terephthalate (PET),&#10;&#9;&#9;a saturated polyester that finds utilization in such applications as fibers for &#10;&#9;&#9;clothing and carpet, food and liquid containers (such as a water/soda bottles), &#10;&#9;&#9;as well as films. &#10;&#10;&#9; &#9;PETâ€™s non-reactance with many foods makes it an ideal packaging material. Because &#10;&#9; &#9;of its easy application and durability, polyester resin is also applied to patch cracks &#10;&#9; &#9;and holes that need to remain watertight.&#10;&#9;
