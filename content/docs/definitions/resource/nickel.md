## Description
&#10;&#9; Nickel is not a major constituent of the Martian crust itself but is enriched in meteorites that have &#10;&#9; impacted the surface, such as iron-nickel meteorites like &quot;Heatshield Rock,&quot; which was found to be &#10;&#9; composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel.&#10; &#10;&#9; These meteorites, along with other fragments like &quot;Barberton&quot; and &quot;Allan Hills,&quot; are evidence of &#10; &#9; extraterrestrial material contributing to the surface composition.&#10;&#10;&#9; In addition to meteoritic nickel, nickel has been detected in specific geological contexts, such as &#10;&#9; dendritic and subspherical concretions in the Pahrump Hills and Hartmann&#39;s Valley, where it correlates &#10;&#9; with magnesium and sulfur.&#10; &#10; &#9; The discovery of high-grade nickel and copper in Jezero crater suggests that ultramafic rocks, which &#10; &#9; are rich in nickel, may be more common on Mars than previously thought.&#10;&#9;
