## Description
Taenite is a major constituent of iron meteorites.&#10;&#9; An alloy of iron and nickel, with nickel proportions of 20% up to 65%. The name is derived&#10;&#9; from the Greek meaning band or ribbon. In octahedrites it is found in bands interleaving&#10;&#9; with kamacite forming Widmanst√§tten patterns, whereas in ataxites it is the dominant&#10;&#9; constituent. In octahedrites a fine intermixture with kamacite can occur, which is&#10;&#9; called plessite. Taenite is one of four known Fe-Ni meteorite minerals: The others are&#10;&#9; kamacite, tetrataenite, and antitaenite.
