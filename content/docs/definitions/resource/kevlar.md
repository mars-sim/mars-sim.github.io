## Description
 Kevlar is a trademark for one of DuPont’s &#10;&#9;&#9;aramid products as both Kevlar and Nomex are examples of chemicals called synthetic aromatic&#10;&#9;&#9;polyamides or aramids for short. The fundamental structure of an aramid is C14H14N2O4.&#10;&#9;&#9;Aramid fibers are short for aromatic polyamide. They are manufactured fibers where the &#10;&#9;&#9;composition is a type of synthetic polyamide, in which more than 85% of the linkages must &#10;&#9;&#9;link to two aromatic rings. Kevlar is prone to soaking up water in composite applications &#10;&#9;&#9;and it’s not ideal in compression, so fiberglass and carbon fiber are used in composites &#10;&#9;&#9;rather than Kevlar in those situations.
