## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;Epoxy resin is a thermoset polymer formed by the polymerization of epichlorohydrin&#10;&#9;&#9;and bisphenol-A.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;It is renowned for its high adhesive strength, excellent chemical and heat resistance, &#10;&#9;&#9;electrical insulation properties, and superior durability for Mining, Civil, &#10;&#9;&#9;Composites, Electrical and Adhesives applications.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10; &#9;&#9;Epoxy is widely used in structural adhesives, fiber-reinforced plastics, industrial &#10; &#9;&#9;coatings, aerospace and marine applications, and as a protective coating for floors, &#10; &#9;&#9;countertops, and storage tanks.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;It is also preferred for repairs due to its ability to bond with both epoxy and &#10;&#9;&#9;polyester surfaces.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10; &#9;&#9;Epoxy generally has a longer curing time than polyester, allowing more working time, &#10; &#9;&#9;and emits fewer, lower-risk fumes during use. However, it is more expensive than &#10; &#9;&#9;polyester resin.&#10;&#9;
