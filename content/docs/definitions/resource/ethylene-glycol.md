## Description
 &#10;&#9;&#9;Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, flammable, and viscous liquid.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;It&#39;s commonly used in various industrial and consumer products, including antifreeze, &#10;&#9;&#9;hydraulic brake fluids, some stamp pad inks, ballpoint pens, solvents, paints, &#10;&#9;&#9;plastics, films, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical vehicles.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;It is also used as a raw material in the manufacture of polyester fibers and&#10;&#9;&#9;primarily used as a component of de-icer and anti-icer/anti-freeze fluid &#10;&#9;&#9;used in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations, and as an anti-freeze &#10;&#9;&#9;component in motor vehicles.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;Ethylene glycol is a popular refrigerants ingredient due to its excellent &#10;&#9;&#9;heat transfer properties and is used in a wide variety of heating and cooling&#10;&#9;&#9;applications such as HVAC systems, plastic mould making, food, and pharmaceutical&#10;&#9;&#9;processes.&#10;&#9;
