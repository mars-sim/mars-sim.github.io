## Description
 Iron(III) chloride, also called ferric chloride,&#10;&#9;is an industrial scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with&#10;&#9;iron in the +3 oxidation state. When dissolved in water, iron(III) chloride undergoes&#10;&#9;hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction. The resulting brown, acidic, and&#10;&#9;corrosive solution is used as a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production,&#10;&#9;and as an etchant for copper-based metals in printed circuit boards. Extracted from akaganeite.
