## Description
&#10;&#9;&#9;The common name for the organic chemical compound propene. An alkene which is a &#10;&#9;&#9;colorless gaseous (at room temperature and pressure) hydrocarbon with the chemical&#10;&#9;&#9;formula C3H6. &#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;It&#39;s a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor and is flammable, and is &#10;&#9;&#9;often used as fuel at room temperature and pressure, with a faint petroleum-like odor. &#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;It is a product of combustion and a unsaturated organic compound with one double bond. &#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;It is widely used in the production of various chemicals, plastics, and fuels.&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;As plastics such as production of resins, fibers, and elastomers (polyolefins).&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;As chemical products such as polypropylene, polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;As fuel for industrial processes and as a component of gasoline and for production &#10;&#9;&#9;of antifreeze and other industrial chemicals.&#10;&#9;&#9;
