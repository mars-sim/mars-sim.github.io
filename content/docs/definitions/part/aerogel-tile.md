## Description
Assume each tile is about 1m x 1m. Excellent for transparent insulation, &#10;&#9;&#9;a silica aerogel tile contain nanoscale networks of interconnecting silica clusters, &#10;&#9;&#9;contain over 97% air by volume and have some of the lowest measured thermal conductivities of &#10;&#9;&#9;any known material (of 0.02 W/m/K at 1 bar pressure or 0.01 W/m/K at Martian atmospheric &#10;&#9;&#9;pressure). Routinely employed in many engineering applications, including &#10;&#9;&#9;NASAâ€™s Mars Exploration Rovers where thin aerogel layers provided night-time thermal &#10;&#9;&#9;insulation. A 3 cm layer of silica aerogel can increase the temperature of the underlying &#10;&#9;&#9;surface by 45 K when it receives a flux of 150 W/m2.
