## Description
Assume each tile is about 1m x 1m. Each board comprises extruded polystyrene (XPS) &#10;&#9;&#9;and expanded polystyrene insulation (EPS) that contain millions of air pockets trapped &#10;&#9;&#9;within the foam. Because the polystyrene itself is also highly resistant to heat, &#10;&#9;&#9;the result is a great thermal insulator which can give excellent R-ratings. &#10;&#9;&#9;XPS is often lined with aluminium foil.
