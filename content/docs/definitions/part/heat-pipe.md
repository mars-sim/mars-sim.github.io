## Description
Heat pipe is a passive heat transfer device with an extremely&#10;&#9;&#9;effective thermal conductivity. Its two-phase heat transfer mechanism&#10;&#9;&#9;results in heat transfer capabilities from one hundred to several thousand&#10;&#9;&#9;times that of an equivalent piece of copper.
