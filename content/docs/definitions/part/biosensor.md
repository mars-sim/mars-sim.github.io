## Description
A biopolymer sensor that can be printed on a wide range of materials &#10;&#9;&#9;for sensing trace levels of pollutants/toxins or whatever airborne/waterborne bacteria &#10;&#9;&#9;and virus. It contains embedded molecular switches consisting of a protein that acts &#10;&#9;&#9;like a lock and key. A target molecule or pathogen binds to the switch, which opens&#10;&#9;&#9;the &#39;lock&#39; to combine to form an enzyme and emits a light indicating the presence and &#10;&#9;&#9;quantity of the target. Useful for pathogen detection, food analysis, medical monitoring,&#10;&#9;&#9;and measurement of pollutants
