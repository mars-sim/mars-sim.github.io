Robert Zubrin once proposed four phases in the economics of Mars colonization. Each represents a new progressive stage of increased human activities toward building a human civilization on Mars.

## EXPLORATION

Orbital survey of Mars, telescopic and robotic survey, precursor sample return, scientific investigations, human flyby/EVA/landing/return;

## BASE BUILDING

Semi-permanent laboratory/habitat modules, crew rotations, water/ice recovery, in-situ fuel production, outpost maintenance/sustainment;

## SETTLEMENT

Colony expansion, food and resources supply chain, terrestrial exploitation, economic viability, industrial production, infrastructure redundancy;

## TERRAFORMING

Altering global climate, large scale geo-engineering, permanently transforming human surface activities.  

Currently, mars-sim focuses primarily in offering a simulation engine showcasing human activities in the aforementioned phase 1 and some phase 2 and a little bit of phase 3. Below are the five core features of mars-sim:
