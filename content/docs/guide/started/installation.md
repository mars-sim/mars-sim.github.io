## Prerequisites

Currently, mars-sim supports Java 21 which is a LTS (Long Term Support release). Requires only JRE 21 for running mars-sim. See [JDK21](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/21)

The application supports Windows or Linux. MacOS is supported but not via a command script; Java must be called directly.

- A UI application based on Java Swing
- A headless server version that can be accessed remotely via an SSH interface.

## Installation Process

The installation process is simple requiring command line access.

1. Select the latest release from the GitHub site[Releases](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/releases).
