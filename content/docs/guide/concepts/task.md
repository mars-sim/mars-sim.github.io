## Overview

Tasks are completed by [Workers]({{% relref "worker" %}}). Each Worker will evaulate the potential Tasks based on a scoring system. The scoring is based on the the Worker's Skills, Attributes, Job and favorites. There is an element of randomness to emulate some freewill but the higher scored Tasks are more likely to be selected but not guaranteed.

Tasks fall into a number of loose categories described below.

### Personal Tasks

These Tasks are for the benefit of the Worker. For example _Sleep_, _Exercise_, _Eat Meal_.

### Settlement Tasks

These Tasks provide a benefit to the Settlement and are the most common. These range from supporting Missions, _Plan Mission_ or _Load Vehicle_, through to Building focused as _Repair Malfunction_, _Tend Greenhouse_.


### Mission Tasks

These Tasks are created as part of a Mission. For example _Negotiate Trade_ as part of a _Trade_ mission.
