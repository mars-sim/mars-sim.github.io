## Overview

There are 2 modes of transport simulated as Vehicles.
1. Ground based such as _Rover_ or _Light Utility Vehicle_ (LUV).
2. Airbourne such as Drones

These are used in specific types of Missions. However the use results in potential malfunctions and hence Vehicles needs [maintenance]({{% relref "maintenance" %}}) to prevent Faults occurring.

## Vehicle Types

A Rover is a pressurized vehicle holding a crew, suitable for long distance traveled. It may be furnished with a sick bay, a lab, etc. LUVs can carry a Worker but it is not pressurized. 

Section on different Vehicle Types

| Explorer Rover | Collect rock samples from remote sites and ice prospecting |
| Long Range Explorer | A new Explorer Rover variant that has larger fuel capacity to traverse farther|
| Transport Rover | Transport people from one settlement to another |
| Cargo Rover | Transport cargo from one settlement to another. Helps out during Emergency Supply Mission and Trading Mission. |
| Light Utility Vehicle (LUV) | A small un-pressurized  utility vehicle with attachable parts. Operated by a single crew. Constructs new site and buildings. Performs mineral and drilling operation for Mining and Exploration Mission. | 
| Delivery Drone | Transport cargoes of goods from one settlement to another |

There can be different varients of the above types representing different models or manufacturers. These are called [Vehicle Specifications]({{% relref "/docs/definitions/vehicle" %}}).

Note that Rovers will be named from a pool of predefined names but Drones and LUVs are named numerically.
