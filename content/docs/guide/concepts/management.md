## Overview
The management of a Settlement relies on the Settlers having various Jobs and Roles assigned. The Roles influence the decision a Settlement takes in terms of Missions or Tasks.

A Person can only have a single Role and a single Job.

## Roles
Roles give Persons the ability to create and control the direction of a Settlement in terms of Missions or Job/Role allocations.
