## Overview
The surface of Mars is an ultimate science laboratory. In mars-sim, settlers may engage in scientific studies of various subjects and levels.

### Science Types

There are 11 subjects of scientific study available in mars-sim : 

| Science Type |
| --- |
| Areology |
| Astronomy |
| Biology |
| Botany |
| Chemistry |
| Engineering |
| Mathematics |
| Medicine |
| Meteorology |
| Physics |
| Psychology |

### Scientific Study

A Scientific Study has a primary research topic based on one of the Science Types. The study passes through numerous phases befor eany benefit is achieved. All researchers that contribute will gain experience in taking part.

| Phase of Study |
| --- |
| Study Proposal |
| Invite Collaborators |
| Primary Research Work |
| Collaboration Research Work |
| Primary Writing Paper|
| Collaboration Writing Paper|
| Peer Review |

Each phase may span a dozen of days. Depending upon the science *level* the study will support a number of collaborators.

Also, the study need not happen in the same settlement. Thus, a three-person team may be collaborating on a **Biology Level 1 Study** remotely and they are hundreds or thousands of km away.

The **Status** or the **Outcome** of a study can be : 
- *Cancelled*
- *Failed* 
- *Succeeded*

### Researchers

A study has a number of Roles that Persons play:
 - *Primary researcher* -- one who initiates a study
 - *Collaborator* -- one who accepts the invitation to join in a study
 - *Assistant* -- one who assists in a study
 - *Reviewer* -- one who does the peer review in a study

> Note: the primary research is responsible for invite collaborators and research assistants.
