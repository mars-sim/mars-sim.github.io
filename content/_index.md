Mars-Sim is a Java-based open-source project that simulates the first generation 

of human beings setting foot on Mars and starting settlements on the planet.

This project features the following 3 major elements of simulations :

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-solid fa-people-group" title="Settlers" %}}

Settlers utilize their prior trainings, job experience, and skills to select tasks to complete the overarching objectives of the settlement. 

Their attributes and personality traits affect how they relate to one another. 

In order to survive, they must harness in-situ resources for life support needs, and produce and maintain parts, robots, equipment and vehicles.

Settlements comprised habitable buildings and utility infrastructures. 

Greenhouses, algae farms, fish ponds are maintained to produce food. 

Manufacturing and resource processing are made to further expand the settlement. 

Trading of goods occur between settlements to facilitate the economic viability of commerce 

Settlements initially follow the roadmaps and mission agendas established by their reporting authorities (such as **NASA**) in exchange for resource and manpower supports from Earth resupply missions.

Surface missions are proposed by experienced mission planners for conducting explorations outside settlement's premise. 

Settlers are to identify regions of Resource of Interest (ROI) for mining exploration. 

Future construction missions include setting up weather stations and communication towers as strategies to unlock transportation corridors that would vastly improve commerce and tourism.
