The Mars-Sim is an open-source, Java-based project that simulates the first generation of human beings setting foot on Mars and starting settlements on the planet.

This project features the following 3 major elements of simulations :

Settlers utilize their prior trainings, job experience, and skills to select tasks to complete the overarching objectives of the settlement. 
Their attributes and personality traits affect how they relate to one another. 
In order to survive, they must harness in-situ resources for life support needs, and produce and maintain parts, robots, equipment and vehicles.

Settlements comprised habitable buildings and utility infrastructures. 
Greenhouses, algae farms, fish ponds are maintained to produce food. 
Manufacturing and resource processing are made to further expand the settlement. 
Trading and commerce occur between settlements. 
Settlements initially follow mission agenda set by their reporting authorities (such as **NASA**) in order to receive supports from Earth resupply missions.

Surface missions are proposed by experienced mission planners for conducting explorations outside settlement's premise. 
Settlers are to identify regions of Resource of Interest (ROI) for mining exploration. 
Future construction missions would set up weather stations and communication towers on major corridors of transportation and commerce.
