# Mars-Sim Example

This is a web site for the Mars-Sim project using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). with the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme.

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://gohugo.io/installation/) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

The first run will take longer as it downloads modules.

## installation

THe installation requires numerous tools.

- Hugo extended version that can be installed as precomplied binary see [Hugo Installation](https://gohugo.io/installation/). Nore Docsy does not work with all versions of Hugo, v0.137.1 does work and is used in the GitHub build
- Go lang needs installing (https://go.dev/learn/)
